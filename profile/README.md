# True Network
A substrate-based blockchain network that powers the reputation systems of the internet.

## Our Mission

The transition to web2 brought centralized platforms that housed diverse digital identities, scattering reputations across various silos. Exiting a platform rendered one's reputation inaccessible, affecting aspects like social following and credit scores. Despite web3 championing self-ownership, reputation remains an overlooked facet, posing challenges in an era where anonymity outstrips accountability.

True Network, a substrate-based blockchain, addresses this void. By empowering entities to establish reputation models, it utilizes Polkadot's security and XCM's inter-connectivity. This innovation enables individuals to truly own their reputations—spanning game scores, credit ratings, social standing—aggregated from diverse chains within the True Network ecosystem.
